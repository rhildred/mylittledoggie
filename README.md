# My Little Doggie ... Lab 7

In this lab you will use [twinery.org](https://twinery.org/) to create your own "choose your own adventure" game. When you are done, you will publish your story to a file:

![publish your story](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB115/twine.png "publish your story")

Then you will upload the file to the dropbox for lab 7. You can see my quick example from class of a [story from my dog's perspective here](https://rhildred.github.io/mylittledoggie).

The lab is worth 3% of your final mark.
